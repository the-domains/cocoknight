  Creating a beautiful and fully animate-able 3D girl offers many challenges,
  and as technology progresses, so does she too. But my goal is not to make her
  photo-realistic. I'm more interested in creating a character that does not
  require different versions for different kinds of shots, and that is easy to
  animate for all purposes.
