I created these three models to apply for a vacancy I had found at the website of [Jagex][0] where applicants were required to complete this test.

The rigging and putting into live action of the troll (below) wasn't part of the test and I did it only to practice a little more with rigging and animating for the Blender Game Engine.

The bookshelf and the troll models were created from the concepts provided by [Jagex][0]. For the melee weapon I had to come up with something of my own.

The limitations were 250 tris for the weapon, 500 tris for the bookshelf and 1000 tris for the troll. Also, max texture size was 128 x 128\.  
My models ended up having 244 tris for the melee weapon, 440 tris for the bookshelf and 982 tris for the troll. Note that the bookshelf didn't need to have faces pointing down, so I deleted them.

All models were created with Wings3D, unwrapping was done with Blender. I then proceeded to 3D-paint the troll and the weapon from inside Blender. Gimp was used for minor adjustments to the textures and to create the texture for the bookshelf.
