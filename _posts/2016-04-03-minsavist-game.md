MINSAVIST Game

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgJn7GnguLQ

Minsavist is a cross-platform game I'm working on in my spare time -- mostly while commuting. The game concept is by cscmeb. Currently it can be played with up to 6 players who can be humans or AI. The AI has different modes and can detect threats as well as secure areas for itself. New to the list of features is an auto-complete functionality that takes over when the game is decided but not all blocks have been filled yet.
