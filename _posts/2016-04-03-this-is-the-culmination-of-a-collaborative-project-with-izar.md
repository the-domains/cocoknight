This is the culmination of a collaborative project with [Izara][1], a good friend and photographer.

First we created the images for the cover, the back and the CD-label. These are entirely 3D-rendered.  
[Izara][1] then completed the design work by creating the two images for the inside.  
It was all sent for print and the CDs were produced and are available on your music store.

We had already produced a visualisation for a different CD case, but we decided to create a new one for this particular case as well.  
The video shows an animation of the finished 3D visualisation and was done just for fun. Hope you enjoy it!

Design, texturing and lighting by [Izara][1]  
Modeling, shading, rigging and animation by [coCoKNIght][2]

Software used: Wings3D, blender (Cycles) and Photoshop
